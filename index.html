				<h1>Jovin Cronin-Wilesmith | Chartbeat Design Project</h1>
				<h2>"How It Works" and "Key Features" Sections of Box Collaboration</h2>
				<p> I was asked to pick one part of my initial design and flesh it out how I would like to see it. I chose to further develop the "How It Works" section and the "Key Features" section. I wanted to highlight each feature as a section that would take a full page rather than a column in a crowded section (note:previous design). By allowing a full page, the reader/user is allowed to focus on each key idea and digest the features one at a time.</p> 
				<p>In addition, I redesigned all of the images that Box presented on their site to match Chartbeat color scheme. I wanted to make them a bit more flat and fun then they were on Box. I believe this makes them more digestible and better represented of a high level idea such as "Cloud Project Collaboration".
